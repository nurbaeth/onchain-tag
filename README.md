# 🏃‍♂️ Onchain Tag Game           
          
**Onchain Tag** is a decentralized version of the classic game of tag (догонялки), fully written in Solidity.        
All player actions — joining, moving, and tagging — are handled directly on the Ethereum blockchain. No backend. No off-chain logic. Pure on-chain fun.

## 🎮 Gameplay     
       
- The game takes place on a **10x10 grid**.         
- Players join the game and are randomly placed on the grid.           
- One player is automatically assigned as **"It"** (the tagger).         
- The "It" can move and **tag** another player by landing on the same grid cell.    
- Once tagged, the other player becomes "It", and the cycle continues.
